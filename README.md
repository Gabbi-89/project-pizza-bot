# Pizza Bot

Pair-programming project, building a text-based bot for ordering pizza. 

## The problem

We started off in JavaScript doing the iteration given in the project brief, where we defined our variables and used prompts to get information from the user. We added if-conditional for cooking time. When we added the different steps into functions it got easier for us to also make it visual with HTML and CSS. We had, in an early step, a quite clear common picture of how we wanted to website to look. 

We wanted the site to look like a chat-bot so we used JavaScript 'remove' and 'add' methods to step-wise show the different chat boxes, where the user first were to order type of pizza and after that number of pizzas. By using the functions in JavaScript we could take the value from the user into the functions and then put the result back into the HTML part - such as order name, price and cooking time. 

When we got the JavaScript to work and also look good in a visual way we started to add some extra features. We added a progress bar in the top of the site and we added a summary box in the end of the site, showing the final order details. We did also manage to create a countdown timer in JavaScript which counts down to when the pizza(s) is/are ready based on the given cooking time.  

In the end we made the website responsive for a smaller media screen as well. 

If we had more time we should have used arrays to create different prices for different pizzas.
