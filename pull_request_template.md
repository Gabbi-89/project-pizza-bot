// Our reflections on how this week's project turned out:
For us it was super fun with pair-programming, even though we both were a bit uncertain beforehand. We are both very happy with the site and that it looks like a Chatbot. 

// Things we'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
We had problems with getting the last function to work according to the syntax we learnt, but with help from Maks we understood that we had tried to call the function before declaring it. So in the end it all worked.

If more time we would also like to learn about and try using objects/arrays but we assume we will get more time for that in the coming weeks.
